I build dashboards, tools, and a few experimental apps — mostly around **structure, clarity, and neurodivergent-friendly design**. A lot of my work sits at the intersection of data, organization, and lived experience in the ASD community.

I like making things that reduce friction, calm the noise, and make complex stuff easier to work with.

## 🚧 What I’m Working On

### 🎧 VolumeCrisis — exploring our relationship with sound  
[`VolumeCrisis`](https://github.com/KarMarsten/VolumeCrisis) is an iOS project focused on **friendlier, more intentional sound awareness** — less jump-scare volume, more gentle feedback and visual grounding.

It’s still evolving, but it’s been a really interesting space to explore.

### 🧰 UseYourTools — job searching with structure (not chaos)  
[`UseYourTools`](https://github.com/KarMarsten/UseYourTools) is a mobile app for job seekers who want organization without spreadsheets taking over.

Built with **React Native + TypeScript + Expo**, it helps with:

- tracking applications & roles  
- organizing resume versions  
- seeing progress & reports at a glance  
- choosing themes that match how your brain works

It started as a tool I needed — and grew from there.

### 📊 Future of Autism — data as storytelling & advocacy  
I also work on my ongoing **Future of Autism** data project, using **R, Python, SQL, and visualization tools** to make autism-related data more approachable and meaningful.

- Kaggle (Volume 1): https://www.kaggle.com/karenlynnmarsten  
- Supporting code + notebooks: [`autism_project`](https://github.com/KarMarsten/autism_project)

This is where my data work and advocacy overlap.

## ✨ A little about how I work

- I like turning messy workflows into calmer systems  
- I care about accessibility and neurodivergent-friendly design  
- I build things people can actually *use*, not just look at
